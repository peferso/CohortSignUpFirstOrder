# CohortSignUpFirstOrder
Two Python applications: building a cohort from simulated data and counting venues in cities using Foursquare API. A report in pdf is included in "exercise-1"

# Building a cohort of Signup's vs first order's
<p>
The folder exercise 1 contains the Python code (<i> library_simulate_data.py </i>) to generate a population of user ID's and signup timestamps:
<table id="pnptab">
		<tr>
			<th> User ID </th>
			<th> sign_up_timestamp </th>			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> 0102V </td>		
			<td> 2018/04/02 </td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td> ... </td>		
			<td> ... </td>
		</tr>
</table>
